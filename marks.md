**Comments**: Both issues failed automated checks with the submission before deadline. Fix for issue #4477 introduces unnecessary import log in line 19. Unnecessary break statement in line 124 and 135. No need to inclue default in line 181. Issue #2787 updatePath method could have had unit tests. Too many pictures make document hard to follow, better organization of pictures or video would have helped tidy up document.
