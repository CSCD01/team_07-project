Comments:

I was very happy to see that the team came fully prepared to deliver a
professional presentation. Every team member seemed to be well
informed and actively participated in the interview.

The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The project was introduced well, including a good demonstration.

The reasons for selecting the project were presented well.

You presented convincing arguments for choosing the software process
and explained the process well. As we've discussed, more detail is
needed, for example, w.r.t the outcomes of each stage.
